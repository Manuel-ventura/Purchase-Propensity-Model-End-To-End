# Purchase Propensity Model: End-to-End

## Introduction

This project focuses on developing and evaluating a purchase propensity model using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses identify customers with the highest conversion probability, thereby optimizing resources and maximizing revenue.

## Objectives

- **Data Extraction:** Gather relevant data for modeling.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare data for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create features that enhance model performance.
- **Model Training:** Train machine learning models to predict purchase propensity.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the model for practical use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manuel-ventura/Purchase-Propensity-Model-End-To-End.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Purchase-Propensity-Model-End-To-End
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Purchase-Propensity-Model-End-To-End.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the end-to-end process of developing the purchase propensity model.

## Results

The project successfully demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a purchase propensity model. The final model helps in identifying customers with a high likelihood of making a purchase, which can be used to target marketing efforts more effectively.
